1.Kruskal algorithm 2.Prim's algorithm 3.running time for insertion and pop from a heap 4. how to make a stream for finite for loops 5.heap implementation for any comparable object  GridOfManyXors - did everything right but still the solution doesn't work leave it v(logV) + ElogV why is prim algorithm mmm - moniker - an informal name

following components to be provided by reactive stream implementations
	- Publisher 
	- Subscriber
	- Subscription
	- Processor
	
- publishers cannot signal more elements than subscribers have requested.

Concurrent linked queue ? 
all the collections in java.util.concurrent and what are they used for ? 

concurrent linked queue 
	- iterators are weakly consistent 
	- size method is not a constant time operation as it requires traversal 
	- memory consistency effects: actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a Concurrent Linked Queue happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the ConcurrentLinkedQueue in another thread. 

what is compare and set operation ?  implementation of concurrent linked queue ? how is garbage collection done ? java memory model  ? what is sun.misc.UNSAFE ? 
https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-sunmiscunsafe . what are class loaders . how is class loading done in java . how does sun.misc.UNSAFE guarantee that it is only called from its own internal classes. reflectionfactory in java . how to create a class in java without calling its constructor . 


sun.misc.unsafe 
	- singleton instance is loaded in a private static field called theUnsafe.
