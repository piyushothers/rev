1.how to increase availability of azure disk types 2.what is availability set ? 3.what are fault domains and update domains 4.scale sets 
5. create a virtual machine scale set 6.list steps required to create a virtual machine set 7. types of public ip and differences between them 
8.availability sets vs scale sets 9.

- an availability set is a logical grouping of VMs within Azure that ensures high availability . it distributes the VMs across multiple fault domains and update domains to minimize downtime during maintenance or hardware failures. 

spot instances are good for batch jobs / non-time critical jobs that can withstand infrastructure failures

Azure files 
- managed file shares
- connect from multiple devices concurrently 
	- from cloud or on-premises
	- from different OS
- supports server message blocks(SMB) and network file system (NFS) protocols 

- file share is analogous to S3 in azure
